## 🔄 Hot-Fix Protocol

### Severity Classifications

- **P0 - Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, complete outages, data loss
- **P1 - High**: Major features broken, API failures, performance issues
- **P2 - Medium**: Minor feature issues, UI problems, non-critical bugs
- **P3 - Low**: Cosmetic issues, documentation updates, optimizations

### Hot-Fix Workflow

1. **Issue Detection** → Triage and classification
2. **Emergency Response** → Immediate containment if P0/P1
3. **Development** → Implement fix and test
4. **Deployment** → Deploy with appropriate urgency
5. **Verification** → Confirm resolution and monitor

## 🔍 Monitoring & Health Checks

### Automated Monitoring

- **System Health**: `node scripts/healthCheck.js`
- **External APIs**: `node scripts/checkExternalApis.js`
- **Smart Contracts**: `node scripts/checkEscrowStatus.js`

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- API response times and error rates
- Smart contract transaction success rates
- Database performance metrics
- User activity and trading volume
- External dependency availability

### Health Check Endpoints

- `GET /api/health` - Basic service health
- `GET /api/status` - Detailed system status

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Security
- Comprehensive test coverage (>95%)
- External security audits
- Emergency pause mechanisms
- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations

### API Security
- EIP-712 signature verification
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure authentication and authorization

### Operational Security
- Environment variable management
- Secure deployment pipelines
- Access control and audit logging
- Incident response procedures

## 📊 Testing Strategy

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests** - Individual component functionality
2. **Integration Tests** - API endpoints and service interactions
3. **E2E Tests** - Complete user workflow validation
4. **Security Tests** - Vulnerability and penetration testing
5. **Performance Tests** - Load and stress testing

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test
npx hardhat test
npx cypress run

# Specific test categories
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:security
```

## 🔄 Rollback Strategy

## Rollback Strategy

### When to Rollback

Immediate rollback triggers:
- Critical security vulnerability
- Data corruption or loss
- Complete system unavailability
- Smart contract exploit detected
- API error rate > 5%
- Database connection failures
- External dependency failures affecting core functionality

### Rollback Procedures

#### 1. Emergency Rollback (< 15 minutes)
**Frontend Rollback**
```bash
# Revert to previous deployment
vercel --prod rollback

# Or manual revert
git revert <commit-hash>
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

**Backend Rollback**
```bash
# Revert backend services
kubectl rollout undo deployment/meta-aggregator-api

# Or manual revert
git revert <commit-hash>
npm run deploy:backend
```

#### 2. Database Rollback
```bash
# Restore from backup
pg_restore --clean --if-exists -d production_db backup_file.dump

# Verify data integrity
npm run db:verify
```

#### 3. Smart Contract Rollback
**Note**: Smart contracts cannot be rolled back once deployed. Mitigation strategies:

**Option A: Pause Contract**
```solidity
// Emergency pause functionality
function emergencyPause() external onlyOwner {
    _pause();
}
```

**Option B: Upgrade Contract (if using proxy pattern)**
```bash
# Deploy new implementation
npx hardhat run scripts/upgrade.js --network mainnet
```

**Option C: Migration Contract**
```bash
# Deploy migration contract to transfer funds
npx hardhat run scripts/deployMigration.js --network mainnet
```

### Rollback Verification

After rollback execution:
- [ ] All services health checks passing
- [ ] API endpoints responding correctly
- [ ] Database queries executing normally
- [ ] Smart contract interactions working
- [ ] Frontend loading and functional
- [ ] Error rates returned to normal
- [ ] User experience restored
